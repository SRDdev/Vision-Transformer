Welcome to the Vision Transformer (ViT) Educational Repository! This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive and educational resource for understanding and implementing Vision Transformers, a novel architecture for computer vision tasks.


## Overview

### What is a Vision Transformer (ViT)?

Vision Transformer, introduced by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. in the paper ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), is a groundbreaking neural network architecture that applies the transformer model to image classification tasks. The ViT architecture has gained widespread attention for its simplicity, scalability, and impressive performance on various vision tasks.

### Features

- Educational content explaining the core concepts of Vision Transformers.
- Implementation of Vision Transformer models using popular deep learning frameworks(pytorch).
- Code examples and tutorials for training ViT models on different datasets.
- Pre-trained models and weights for quick experimentation.
- Community contributions and discussions to foster collaborative learning.

### Why Replication Machine Learning Research Papers ?
A machine learning research paper is often a presentation of months of work and experiments done by some of the best machine learning teams in the world condensed into a few pages of text.

And if these experiments lead to better results in an area related to the problem you're working on, it'd be nice to check them out.

Also, replicating the work of others is a fantastic way to practice your skills.
