Welcome to the Vision Transformer (ViT) Educational Repository! This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive and educational resource for understanding and implementing Vision Transformers, a novel architecture for computer vision tasks.


## Overview

### What is a Vision Transformer (ViT)?

Vision Transformer, introduced by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. in the paper ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), is a groundbreaking neural network architecture that applies the transformer model to image classification tasks. The ViT architecture has gained widespread attention for its simplicity, scalability, and impressive performance on various vision tasks.

### Features

- Educational content explaining the core concepts of Vision Transformers.
- Implementation of Vision Transformer models using popular deep learning frameworks.
- Code examples and tutorials for training ViT models on different datasets.
- Pre-trained models and weights for quick experimentation.
- Community contributions and discussions to foster collaborative learning.
